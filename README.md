## üìù Why Sport Sync?
In today's fast-paced and busy era, it's important for us to stay active and healthy. However, we often face two major challenges: difficulty in finding the right sports facilities and suitable partners who share our interests and schedules. This is the foundation for the creation of our app.

Our SportSync app provides a comprehensive solution to both of these problems. First, we offer recommendations for nearby sports facilities with detailed reviews and information, so you no longer have to worry or search for a place to exercise. From futsal courts to swimming pools, everything is at your fingertips with our app, and you can even make bookings directly from your phone.

More importantly, we understand that exercising is more enjoyable when done with others. We realize that busy schedules often become a barrier for many people to find suitable playmates. That's why we introduce a partner search feature that not only allows you to find people around you with similar interests in specific sports, but also gives you the flexibility to adjust your playing schedule. With this, we aim to make it easier for you to connect with fellow sports enthusiasts, even when daily busyness gets in the way.
